Shredding the image, like the illustration, is the equivalent of \"pooling\" in CNN.  A weird pooling scheme of size [1x2] with stride=2, constantly sampling from the left cell (0,1) to generate one image.  Likewise, another pooling operator samples only from the right cell (0,2) to develop the second image.",

Certainly 2 photos were used which were not shown in the video to make us fool. And the same story goes for creating the 4 photos. The problem is that people have stopped using their logical sense to analyse any post\/ video. ",

Think MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server. These organize data in tables with clear relationships, making them perfect for complex queries and data integrity. They're the go-to for most business applications.NoSQL Databases:\u00a0\u00a0Flexibility is key here! MongoDB and Cassandra are popular examples. NoSQL handles unstructured data with ease and boasts impressive performance for massive datasets. Ideal for big data, content management, and real-time applications.Graph Databases:\u00a0\u00a0Let's get connected! Neo4j shines when it comes to networked data and social relationships. Graph databases excel at fraud detection, recommendations, and knowledge graphs.Time Series Databases:\u00a0\u00a0All about the time! InfluxDB is built for timestamped, sequenced data. It's a great fit for IoT, DevOps, and sensor data analysis.Object Databases: Think objects, not tables! db4o is an example here. Object databases excel at working with media files, search engines, and engineering design systems.Choosing the Right Database:\u00a0\u00a0It's all about your needs! Data structure, relationships, scalability, and performance all play a role.

Another concern is the complexity of implementing log modification and indexing pipelines without introducing Logstash between Kafka and Elasticsearch.

Personally, I've found a simpler solution: forwarding logs using a dedicated log forwarder and then receiving them with Logstash before indexing them into Elasticsearch. This streamlined approach greatly simplifies our workflow and enhances efficiency.",

It enables applications to both publish and subscribe to real-time data feeds, boasting high throughput for both producers and consumers of record streams, and facilitating the real-time processing of these data streams.\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddde\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddee \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4?Kafka Streams is a powerful client library for stream processing, deeply integrated with Apache Kafka.

However, 'zero-copy' Kafka enhances this further by utilizing an optimized data transfer mechanism. It circumvents the traditional application layer, transferring data directly from the file system cache to the network socket buffer. This minimizes CPU overhead and reduces data copying (hence 'zero-copy'), resulting in significantly improved throughput and reduced latency. Essentially, Zero-Copy Kafka provides an accelerated version of Kafka, tailored for even more efficient data handling.\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd \ud835\udff1 \ud835\uddde\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddee \ud835\udde8\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00:1. \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4: Kafka acts as a real-time conduit for high-volume data streams, analogous to channeling a dynamic river of information. It empowers the creation of applications that are capable of immediate data transformation and reaction as the information flows between various systems.2. \ud835\udddf\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb: Kafka addresses the challenge of managing colossal volumes of log data generated every second. It provides a unified, high-throughput, and low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds, thereby becoming an optimal solution for efficient log aggregation in distributed system architectures.3. \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde4\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf2: In modern architectures, particularly those employing microservices, Kafka serves as an advanced message queuing system. It offers significant advantages over traditional message queues, with its inherent scalability, built-in fault tolerance, replication capabilities, and high durability.4. \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddef \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4: Kafka is adept at meticulously tracking web activities such as page views, searches, and uploads, in a real-time and large-scale manner. It acts as a continuous monitor of user interactions on websites, providing invaluable insights for user experience enhancements.5. \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb: Kafka plays a pivotal role in the reliable and consistent transfer of data between different systems.
